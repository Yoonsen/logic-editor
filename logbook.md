### Major UI Enhancement: Extended Symbol Table
- Added fifth column to the symbol table
- Increased table width to 280px to accommodate new column
- Added comprehensive set of mathematical symbols:
  - Set theoretic symbols (∈, ∉, ⊂, ⊃, ∅, etc.)
  - Number sets (ℕ, ℤ, ℚ, ℝ, ℂ)
  - Cardinality symbols (ℵ, ℵ₀, ℵ₁, ℵ₂, ℵ₃)
  - Subscripts (₀, ₁, ₂, ₃, ₄, ₅)
  - Superscripts (⁰, ¹, ², ³, etc. and ⁿ, ᵐ, ᵏ, ᵗ, ᵈ)

### Technical Notes
- All symbols implemented as Unicode characters for universal compatibility
- Maintained responsive design and mobile compatibility
- No changes to core functionality required
- Layout adjustments made to accommodate new column while preserving usability

### Performance Considerations
- Identified potential performance optimizations for LaTeX rendering
- Noted possible improvements for mobile performance
- Considered virtualization for symbol table in future updates

### Next Steps
- Test on mobile devices
- Monitor performance with extended symbol set
- Consider implementing performance optimizations
- Gather user feedback on new symbol availability
